REFLECTION:

This was even tougher than the last one!

I could not handle the try/catch errors. perhaps we can go over this in class? I dont quite understand what it is, even after googling.
I also tried my best to add interesting animations to it for example when upgrades are clicked i wanted them to float around at the bottom of the screen but could not do it sadly
